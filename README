Sensi - set of infrastructure utilities which run on NodeJS

Sensi is a set of infrastructure utilities that you can use internally on your
projects. All utilities are written in NodeJS and are all fast event driven
applications written in JavaScript.

But don't be scared, most utilities fall at just a couple of hundred lines so
they are easily understanable and can be extended to your own needs. Patches
welcome :)

I wanted to release this code as AGPv3 but I want it to be used in
organisations backends which don't necessarily want to release the code for
their own applications (not that they'd have to anyway) so instead have chosen
the GPLv3 or later license for all programs.
