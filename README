Sensi is a set of infrastructure utilities that you can use internally on your
projects. All utilities are written in NodeJS and are all fast event driven
applications written in JavaScript.

But don't be scared, most utilities fall at just a couple of hundred lines so
they are easily understandable and can be extended to your own needs. Patches
are welcome though this is opinionated software - they each do one thing and do
it well - keeping them simple is the aim of the game. :)

Sensi currently contains:

* a queue system - sensi-queue.js

In the future, Sensi will also contain:

* a notification system
* a file storage system

... and maybe some other things too.
