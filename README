Sensi - a set of 'Infrastructure as a Service' utilities which run on NodeJS.

Sensi is a set of infrastructure utilities that you can use internally on your
projects. All utilities are written in NodeJS and are all fast event driven
applications written in JavaScript.

But don't be scared, most utilities fall at just a couple of hundred lines so
they are easily understanable and can be extended to your own needs. Patches
welcome :)

Sensi currently contains:

* a queue system

In the future, Sensi will also contain:

* a distributed queue system
* a notification system
* a distributed notification system

... and maybe some other things too.
